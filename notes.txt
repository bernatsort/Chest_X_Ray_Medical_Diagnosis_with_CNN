Data augmentation:
- makes it hard for the model to simply memorize features 
  and forces it to learn a good representation (more generalizable) of the data.
- Example: The model sees an image and decides to relate its background color with the correct class.
           Then sees an augmented image with a different color. Dang it! It has to learn something 
           different because color isnâ€™t the one.
